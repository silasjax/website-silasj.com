Effects of Gender, Self-Concepts, and Perceptions of Scientists is that girls are less likely to pursue science careers because they feel their self-concept(s) are not in line with the expectation of what a scientist is like. This suggests that, at least in part, students tend to pursue careers which they feel are congruent with their self-concept. However, this view does not account for whether college students consider their education a means to pursue their passions and express a part of their “true” self, or as a path to obtaining a lucrative career. Further, research on academic self-concept almost exclusively focuses on achievement as its main indicator or correlate.\nI argue that achievement is only one aspect of academic self-concept and research on this topic must account for academic gratification. That said, I seek to (1) examine whether students college major is more influenced by careerist goals or self-concepts, (2) explore how others’ perceptions (reflected appraisals) affect their self-concept and overall satisfaction with their major, (3) reveal if students who choose their major based on self-concept are more or less satisfied with their major, and (4) investigate students’ attitudes about their perceptions of their future success as it relates to the conclusions above.\n Research Questions  What is the role of self-concept in students’ choice of college major? Are students more likely to choose a major based on self-concept or career outcomes? Are students who choose a major based on self-concept more or less satisfied than those who choose a major on career outcomes?

Having a wide range of interests and not yet discovering a love for quantitative analysis, I graduated with a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s of science in interdisciplinary studies with minors in philosophy and writing.\nFollowing my undergraduate studies, I completed three years of graduate coursework at West Virginia University in sociology and statistics. At WVU, I discovered a knack for statistical analysis and sought to strengthen those skills by taking courses in areas such as experimental design, survey methods, and data visualization.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not tinkering around in RStudio, I enjoy weightlifting, karaoke, and spending time with my cat, Bagel.\n  Download my resumé.\n  Bagel Jackson  ","date":1618704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618704000,"objectID":"2421b78af96cad43962875d354d08809","permalink":"https://www.silasj.com/about/about-me/","publishdate":"2021-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/about-me/","section":"about","summary":"Hello!\nMy name is Silas.

Do men and women differ in their perceptions of hazing?   Methods Survey Download the survey here.\n  Sample Characteristics  Determination of Guilt and Punishment  General Views about Hazing  Creating the Hazing Score Variable The hazing score is a numeric representation of how positively or negatively a participant views hazing in general. The score can range from -18 to 18 and higher values indicate less positive views of hazing. The score was generated using 9 of the 15 Likert scale level of agreement items included in the survey.\n All initiations of new group members are hazing. An action is not hazing if the victim consents. Hazing is useful for group cohesion Hazing can be fun. Hazing is a serious issue which needs to be prevented. Hazing is dangerous Hazing should be illegal. Sometimes hazing is acceptable. There are no benefits to hazing new group members.

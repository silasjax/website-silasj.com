Hello!

My name is Silas. I am an aspiring data analyst and R enthusiast. I am from McKeesport, PA which is located in the suburbs or Pittsburgh. I attended Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania from 2014 through 2018. Having a wide range of interests and not yet discovering a love for quantitative analysis, I graduated with a bachelor's of science in interdisciplinary studies with minors in philosophy and writing. 

Following my undergraduate studies, I completed three years of graduate coursework at West Virginia University in sociology and statistics. At WVU, I discovered a knack for statistical analysis and sought to strengthen those skills by taking courses in areas such as experimental design, survey methods, and data visualization.

When I'm not tinkering around in RStudio, I enjoy weightlifting, karaoke, and spending time with my cat, Bagel.
